# SpaceDodge


Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PBqxtP_OO4&t=40s

This is a multiplayer game I created in QtCreator using the C++ Programming language

You and any amount of players will compete to dodge black holes and gain points through several different space objects.

As a player, you are a flying saucer that moves with the arrow keys.

The player with the most points wins. Good luck!
